# MCU to compile for
CONFIG_MCU=atmega644p

# Use the -relax parameter when linking?
# Passing -O9 and -relax to the linker saves ~650 bytes of flash,
# but the option is broken in certain binutils versions.
# (known troublemakers: binutils 2.17, 2.18 seems fine)
CONFIG_LINKER_RELAX=n

# MCU frequency in Hz - the fastloader code is hardcoded for 8MHz

# Output a hex dump of all received commands via serial?
# Not used if CONFIG_UART_DEBUG is disabled.

# Select which hardware to compile for
# Valid values:
#   1 - custom configuration in config.h
#   2 - Shadowolf MMC2IEC PCBs version 1.x

CONFIG_TWINSD=y

# Additional storage device support
# You don't need to enable the "native" storage device of your hardware
# here, the build system will add that itself (requires definitions in
